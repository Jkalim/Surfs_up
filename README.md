# Surfs_Up

## Project Overview
The purpose of the analysis is to determine temperature data for the months of June and December in Oahu, 
in order to determine if the surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round. By comparing the statistics
of these two month, W. Avy can make an informed decision before opening the surf shop


## Resuslts
After the analysis the following are three key difffences between June and December: 
 1) The mean temperature is higher in june at 74.94 than it is in December at 71.04. However the temperature is acceptable
 for both months considering a lower tempreature was expected in the winter time. 
 
 2) The max and min temperature for june are respectively 85 and 64 compared to December's max and min temperature of 
 respectively 83 and 56. The max temperature from both month are fairly close but there is a considerable gap in their
 minimum temperature. 

 3) The standard deviation of June temperature is 3.25 compared to December's 3.74. Given both standard deviations are
 so low, it reinforces the fact that the temperatures of both month are generally around the mean temperature of both month
 which is 74 for June and 71 for December. 
  
## Summary
The max, min and average temperature of June are respectively 85, 64, and 74 while December's are respectively 83, 56, and 71. 
Considering how low the standard deviation is for both months (3.25 for June and 3.74 for December), most of the data for both 
months are closer the average temperatures; which mean that most days the temperature are closer to 74 in June and 71 in December
which mean the these two month surfers will definitely be visiting the surf shop. Gathering data for precipitation in June and 
December would help W. Avy determine how many slow days are expected during these two months. ANother wuery that could be useful 
is to gather temperature and precipitation data by seasons which would give the expectation year round.
